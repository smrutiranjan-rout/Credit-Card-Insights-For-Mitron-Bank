## Problem statement

Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. 

AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr.Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing them the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spend and other details.

The role is to analyse the provided sample data and report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends.
